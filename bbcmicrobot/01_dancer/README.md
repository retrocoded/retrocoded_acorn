## BBC Microbot - Dancer ## 

I had high hopes for this concept - a stick figure that can be made to 'dance'. The issue is there is already too many specifics needed to encode the simplest of figures, that there is very limited space left to encode any detailed animations that could be called a dance! This was as far as I got. With the ability to animate only two joints in a simple way...it was a David Brent dance that ended up being produced. I include four versions here to detail the progression of the sourcecode at interesting points of progression. 

The learnings from this are that one is better offer targeting generative art than procedural animation when one has only 255 encoded characters to play with!
